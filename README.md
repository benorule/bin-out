# bin-out

## Deployed Application
https://bin-out.herokuapp.com/

## Description
Bin-out is an application which allows users to submit a request for their bins to be taken out for collection when they are unable to. Once a request is sent, a local employee can choose to accept and fulfil the request. This application is useful for people who are unable to put their bins out, potentially due to being away from their property, having a physical condition or being elderly and unagile.

## User Story
Because I am unable to take my bins out,
I would like to be able to submit a request for someone to take my bins out on certain days.

WHEN a request is sent, 
THEN the address and date of request is sent to local employees.

WHEN an employee accepts a request,
THEN the request is removed from the active requests table.
